# Running Your Own Instance of 5eTools
This page describes methods for accessing 5eTools content other than the [5e.tools](https://5e.tools) website. This is useful if you would like to access 5eTools content offline, or you want to auto-load homebrew specific to your group or campaign. 

# Get the 5eTools source code
Go to [get.5e.tools](https://get.5e.tools) to download the latest release of the main site.
