## Page Layout
The website's content is laid out in a simple format that changes to fit the subjects being shown. This section shows how to best use/understand the features implemented using said format.

### Website Navbar
The Navbar appears at the top of most of the pages on the site and helps quickly navigate between its features. It helps identify at a glance what page you are on, and even gives some specific advice for its use, as well as a link to the wiki for the site's feature(s).

### OmniSearch
Each page outside of the DM screen will have the Omnisearch box. Denoted by a bar on the right side of the navbar, with the words "Search everywhere..." inside of it.

The Omnisearch box looks over the dataset's titles for matching content. It does not search the description (ie `Fluff`) text, but instead focuses upon key data fields in Monster, Items, Tables, Rules, Feats, etc. fields like title, name.

### Dice Roller
At the bottom of most pages, there will be this icon ![24px-rollerbutton.webp](/assets/24px-rollerbutton.webp =12x). When it is clicked, it will open a small window which can be used to either roll or return the results of actions triggered by clicking other elements of the site, usually triggered by a link on the page that most often looks like 2d10 this. (There are some instructions on how to do this within the JSON data in the Renderer Demo should you want to enable this for your own documents - see Homebrew.

The roller uses the common format for dice rolling, `<a>d<X>` where `<a>` is the number of dice rolled `<X>` number of times. The results are presented to the roller window with separate entries, and then the sum of the rolls are calculated as well.

### Reference Pages
Reference pages are for content with dense data; things like Items; Tables; Monsters/Bestiary; Feats; Spells; etc. Things that having a filter for content is most helpful with.

The following image is a color-coded representation of a fairly common layout of the site's information. The various highlighted regions are covered in brief below. 
![650px-screen_reference_labeled.webp](/assets/650px-screen_reference_labeled.webp =50%x)

#### 1. Website Navbar
The Navbar appears above most of the features of the site and helps quickly navigate between its features. The bar shifts to include the current page's title and some specific advice for its use, and a link to the wiki for the site's feature(s).

#### 2. Filter
The filter interface is a quick and easy way to break down the results into usable 'chunks' for use. 


#### 3. Filter's Results List
This pane lists a number of columns which can be sorted by clicking on the column's heading, which will then be denoted after the column's title by either FilterResultsAscending.PNG (ascending) or FilterResultsDescending.PNG (descending).

By selecting an entry on the filter's result list, the panel on the (5Ô∏è‚É£) right-hand pane side of the webpage will open up with the content, and will update with the detailed information as it is selected.

You can choose what is being displayed on the right panel by either using the mouse to select it, or using the J or K keys to manually move through the list of options.
  
#### 4. Pinned List & Information Pane Controls
Atop the information pane are set of controls and an area for pinning selections to make a list for your reference and use.
ResultElement.png - these provide access to additional tabs of information
Website ui2.png or Website UI.PNG - are used to make a pinned list, pull the information into a separate window, copy a link to the data for saving/sharing elsewhere, or upload or download the pinned list.
  
#### 5. Information Pane
On the right-hand side of the website, the detailed information from the selected item in the Filter's Result List pane (3Ô∏è‚É£) will be displayed.
This will differ from page to page and as such some entries will have elements which (Website UI.PNG and/or ResultElement.png) which will provide additional information, pin or remove customized lists, Show the source JSON data for modification in the Homebrew Builder, link to the entry directly, or link to manage homebrew sources for the content being used for that section's data.
  
#### 6. Dice Roller
At the bottom of most pages, there will be this icon RollerButton.png. When it is clicked (as the animation shows) it will open a small window that can be used to either roll or return the results of actions triggered by clicking other elements of the site, usually triggered by a link on the page that most often looks like 2d10 this. (There are some instructions on how to do this within the JSON data in the Renderer Demo should you want to enable this for your own documents - see Homebrew.
The roller uses the common format for dice rolling (that being <a>d<X> where <a> is the number of dice rolled for a die with <X> number of sides. The results of the roll(s) is(are) presented to the roller window with separate entries, and then the sum of the rolls are calculated as well.
